# CIT Resewn (Legacy Fork for 1.21.x)

This is an unofficial **LEGACY fork** of the original [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) mod, updated to work on **Minecraft 1.21.x** (specifically tested on 1.21.4).

I finally managed to port it!

## ⚠️ What is "LEGACY"?

This version is called **LEGACY** because it is a **stripped-down** port focusing **only on the core CIT (Custom Item Textures) functionality**.

To keep the mod lightweight and avoid unnecessary dependencies, the following have been **completely removed**:

*   **❌ No ModMenu integration**
*   **❌ No Cloth Config dependency**
*   **❌ No extra libraries**

✅ **Pure CIT functionality, nothing else.**

This means there is no configuration screen, but the mod does exactly what it was made for: applying custom item textures from resource packs like Xalis Enchanted Books or any other OptiFine-compatible CIT packs.
