# CIT Resewn — LEGACY/STANDALONE FORK for 1.21.x

This is an unofficial fork of the original [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) mod, updated to work on **Minecraft 1.21.x** (tested on 1.21.4).

Two versions are available: **LEGACY** and **STANDALONE**.

---

## ⚔️ LEGACY — Stripped-down version

**LEGACY** is a **lightweight, stripped-down** port focusing **only on the core CIT (Custom Item Textures) functionality**.

To keep the mod minimal and dependency-free, the following have been **removed**:

*   ❌ **No ModMenu integration**
*   ❌ **No Cloth Config dependency**
*   ❌ **No extra libraries**

✅ **Pure CIT functionality, nothing else.**

This version has no configuration screen — it just works. Perfect if you only need custom item textures.

---

## 🧩 STANDALONE — Full version

**STANDALONE** is the **complete, unmodified version**, based directly on the **original source code** with **no features removed**.

It includes:

*   ✅ Full **ModMenu** integration
*   ✅ Full **Cloth Config API** support
*   ✅ All original settings and dependencies
*   ✅ A full-featured configuration screen

**STANDALONE** means **"everything the original author intended"** — all integrations, all settings, all dependencies. It is **self-contained** precisely *because* it keeps all these features.
